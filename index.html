                        The goal of this section is to give a brief introduction to three.js. 
                        We will start by setting up a scene, with a spinning cube. A working 
                        example is provided at the bottom of the page in case you get stuck 
                        and need help.

                    <p>
                        Before you can use three.js, you need somewhere to display it. Save 
                        the following HTML to a file on your computer, along with a copy of 
                        three.js in the js/ directory, and open it in your browser.
                    </p>

                    <p>To actually be able to display anything with three.js, we need three things: 
                        scene, camera and renderer, so that we can render the scene with camera.
                    </p>

                    <!-- </pre> -->
                    <p>
                        Let's take a moment to explain what's going on here. We have now set up the 
                        scene, our camera and the renderer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are a few different cameras in three.js. For now, let's use a 
                        <strong>PerspectiveCamera</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first attribute is the <strong>field of view</strong>. FOV is the extent of the scene 
                        that is seen on the display at any given moment. The value is in degrees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second one is the <strong>aspect ratio</strong>. You almost always want to use the width 
                        of the element divided by the height, or you'll get the same result as when 
                        you play old movies on a widescreen TV - the image looks squished.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next two attributes are the <strong>near</strong> and <strong>far</strong> clipping plane. What that means, is that objects 
                        further away from the camera than the value of far or closer than near won't be rendered. 
                        You don't have to worry about this now, but you may want to use other values in your apps to 
                        get better performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next up is the renderer. This is where the magic happens. In addition to the WebGLRenderer we 
                        use here, three.js comes with a few others, often used as fallbacks for users with older browsers 
                        or for those who don't have WebGL support for some reason.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to creating the renderer instance, we also need to set the size at which we want it to render our 
                        app. It's a good idea to use the width and height of the area we want to fill with our app - in this case, 
                        the width and height of the browser window. For performance intensive apps, you can also give <strong>setSize</strong> smaller 
                        values, like <strong>window.innerWidth/2</strong> and <strong>window.innerHeight/2</strong>, which will make the app render at half size.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you wish to keep the size of your app but render it at a lower resolution, you can do so by calling <strong>setSize</strong> with false as <strong>updateStyle</strong> 
                        (the third argument). For example, <strong>setSize(window.innerWidth/2</strong>, <strong>window.innerHeight/2, false)</strong> will render your app at half resolution, given 
                        that your &lt;canvas&gt; has 100% width and height.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Last but not least, we add the renderer element to our HTML document. This is a &lt;canvas&gt; element the 
                        renderer uses to display the scene to us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em style="color: red;"> "That's all good, but where's that cube you promised?"</em>
                        Let's add it now.
                    </p>

    <span class="js-var-name">camera</span>.<span class="js-var-name">position</span>.z = 5;
                        </code>
                    <!-- </pre> -->
                    <p>To create a cube, we need a <strong>BoxGeometry</strong>. This is an object that contains all the points (<strong>vertices</strong>) 
                        and fill (<strong>faces</strong>) of the cube. We'll explore this more in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the geometry, we need a material to color it. Three.js comes with several 
                        materials, but we'll stick to the <strong>MeshBasicMaterial</strong> for now. All materials take an object 
                        of properties which will be applied to them. To keep things very simple, we only supply a 
                        color attribute of <strong>>0x00ff00</strong>, which is green. This works the same way that colors work in CSS 
                        or Photoshop (<strong>hex colors</strong>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third thing we need is a <strong>Mesh</strong>. A mesh is an object that takes a geometry, and 
                        applies a material to it, which we then can insert to our scene, and move freely around.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By default, when we call <strong>scene.add()</strong>, the thing we add will be added to the coordinates <strong>(0,0,0)</strong>. This 
                        would cause both the camera and the cube to be inside each other. To avoid this, we simply move 
                        the camera out a bit.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Rendering the scene</h2>
                    <p>If you copied the code from above into the HTML file we created earlier, you wouldn't be able to see 
                        anything. This is because we're not actually rendering anything yet. For that, we need what's called 
                        a <strong>render</strong> or <strong>animate</strong> loop.
                    </p>
                    <!-- <pre> -->
                        <code>
    <span class="js-fn-kw">function</span> animate() {
        requestAnimationFrame( <span class="js-obj-name">animate</span> );
        <span class="js-obj-name">renderer</span>.render( <span class="js-obj-name">scene</span>, <span class="js-obj-name">camera</span> );
    }
    animate();
                        </code>
                    <!-- </pre> -->
                    <p>
                        This will create a loop that causes the renderer to draw the scene every time the screen is 
                        refreshed (on a typical screen this means 60 times per second). If you're new to writing games in the browser, 
                        you might say "why don't we just create a setInterval ?" The thing is - we could, but <strong>requestAnimationFrame</strong> has 
                        a number of advantages. Perhaps the most important one is that it pauses when the user navigates to another 
                        browser tab, hence not wasting their precious processing power and battery life.

                    <h2>Animating the cube</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you insert all the code above into the file you created before we began, you should see a 
                        green box. Let's make it all a little more interesting by rotating it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Add the following right above the renderer.render call in your animate function:
                    </p>
                    <!-- <pre> -->
                        <code>
    <span class="js-obj-name">cube</span>.<span class="js-obj-name">rotation</span>.x += <span class="js-float">0.01</span>;
    <span class="js-obj-name">cube</span>.<span class="js-obj-name">rotation</span>.y += <span class="js-float">0.01</span>;
                        </code>
                    <!-- </pre> -->
                    <p>
                        This will be run every frame (normally 60 times per second), and give the cube a nice 
                        rotation animation. Basically, anything you want to move or change while the app is running 
                        has to go through the animate loop. You can of course call other functions from there, so that 
                        you don't end up with a <strong>animate</strong> function that's hundreds of lines.

                    <p>
                        While importing three.js via script tags is a great way to 
                        get up and running fast, it has a few drawbacks for longer 
                        lived projects, for example:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            You have to manually fetch and include a copy of the 
                            library as part of your project's source code
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Updating the library's version is a manual process
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When checking in a new version of the library your version 
                            control diffs are cluttered by the many lines of the build 
                            file
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Using a dependency manager like npm avoids these caveats by allowing 
                        you to simply download and import your desired version of the library 
                        onto your machine.

                    <p>
                        Three.js is published as an npm module, see: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/three" target="_blank">npm</a>. 
                        This means all you need to do to include three.js into your project is run "npm install 
                        three"

                        Assuming that you're bundling your files with a tool such as <a href="https://webpack.github.io/" target="_blank">Webpack</a> or 
                        <a href="https://github.com/browserify/browserify" target="_blank">Browserify</a>, which allow you to "require('modules')" in the browser by bundling 
                        up all of your dependencies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You should now be able to import the module into your source files and continue to 
                        use it as per normal.

                    <h2>Importable Examples</h2>
                    <p>
                        The core of three.js is focused on the most important components of a 3D engine. 
                        Many other components like loaders or controls are part of the examples directory. 
                        three.js ensures that these files are kept in sync with the core but users have to 
                        import them separately if they are required for a project. You can find in the <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/examples/jsm">examples/jsm</a> 
                        directory an ES6 module version for almost all example files. If you install three.js via 
                        npm, you can import them like so:
                    </p>
                    <!-- <pre> -->
                        <code>

        <span class="attr-txt">'three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js'</span>;
                        </code>
                    <!-- </pre> -->
                    <p>
                        Note: When using code from the examples directory, it's important that all files match 
                        the version of your three.js main file. For example, it's not acceptable to use <strong>GLTFLoader</strong> 
                        and <strong>OrbitControls</strong> from R96 together with three.js R103.

                    <p>
                        Three.js can use WebGL to render your scenes 
                        on all modern browsers. For older browsers, 
                        especially Internet Explorer 10 and below, you 
                        may have to fallback to one of the other 
                        <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/examples/jsm/renderers" target="_blank">renderers</a> 
                        (CSS2DRenderer, CSS3DRenderer, SVGRenderer). Additionally, 
                        you may have to include some polyfills, especially if 
                        you are using files from the /examples folder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note: if you don't need to support these old browsers, 
                        then it is not recommended to use the other renderers as 
                        they are slower and support less features than the WebGLRenderer.

                    If you use just procedural geometries and don't load any textures, webpages should work 
                    straight from the file system, just double-click on HTML file in a file manager and it should 
                    appear working in the browser (you'll see file:///yourFile.html in the address bar).

                    three.js is a JavaScript-based library. However, it's possible to use it 
                    in a TypeScript project, as the library exposes <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html" target="_blank">Declaration Files</a> (d.ts files).

                    A minimal configuration is required for the TypeScript compiler to discover three.js types.
                    You will need to set the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html" target="_blank">moduleResolution</a> 
                    option to node, and the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html" target="_blank">target</a> option to es6 or newer.

                    Starting with three.js R95, the engine supports rendering with a WebGL 2 context. 
                    By default three.js always uses a WebGL 1 context when creating an instance of 
                    <strong>WebGLRenderer</strong>. If you want use a WebGL 2 context, please have a look at the following 
                    workflow.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        Since WebGL 2 is not supported by all devices that support WebGL 1, it's important to 
                        check the respective availability. To do so, please include 
                        <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/jsm/WebGL.js" target="_blank"></a>WebGL.js

                    <p>
                        Now it's time to create the renderer by applying the HTML5 canvas element and the 
                        respective WebGL 2 context to the constructor of <strong>WebGLRenderer</strong>. As a result, three.js 
                        will internally use the given context for rendering and automatically convert the 
                        built-in material's shader code to GLSL ES 3.00.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since you are manually creating the WebGL 2 rendering context, you also have to pass in 
                        all necessary context attributes. Note: It's not possible to modify these attributes after 
                        the context has been created, so passing them to the WebGLRenderer won't have any effect.
                    </p>

                        Sometimes it is necessary to write custom shader code. Use the following code template

                    <p>
                        Right now, the engine does only support a subset of all existing WebGL 2 features. 
                        The following list provides an overview about what's already available in the latest 
                        version of three.js.

                            Non-power of two (POT) textures work just the same as POT textures now. No resizing 
                            is required for best quality.

                    Let's say you want to draw a line or a circle, not a wireframe <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/objects/Mesh" target="_blank">Mesh</a>. 
                    First we need to set up the <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/renderers/WebGLRenderer" target="_blank">renderer</a>, <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/scenes/Scene" target="_blank">scene</a> and camera (see the Creating

                    Note that lines are drawn between each consecutive pair of vertices, but not between the

                <p>

                <p>
                    There are often times when you might need to use text in your three.js application - 
                    here are a couple of ways that you can do so.
                </p>

                <article>
                    <h2>1. DOM + CSS</h2>
                    <p>
                        Using HTML is generally the easiest and fastest manner to add text. This is the method 
                        used for descriptive overlays in most three.js examples.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can add content to a</p>
                    <!-- <pre> -->
                        <code>
    <span class="tag">&lt;div</span> <span class="attr-name">id</span>=<span class="attr-txt">"info"</span><span class="tag">&gt;</span>Description<span class="tag">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
                        </code>
                    <!-- </pre> -->
                    <p>
                        and use CSS markup to position absolutely at a position above all others with a z-index 
                        especially if you are running three.js full screen.

                    <p>
                        Use this method if you wish to draw text easily on a plane in your three.js scene.

                    <p>
                        Use this method if you prefer working with your 3d applications and importing the models 
                        to three.js

                    <h2>4. Procedural Text Geometry</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you prefer to work purely in THREE.js or to create procedural and dynamic 3D text 
                        geometries, you can create a mesh whose geometry is an instance of THREE.TextGeometry:
                    </p>
                    <!-- <pre> -->
                        <code>
    <span class="js-fn-kw">new</span> <span class="js-class-name">THREE</span>.<span class="js-class-name">TextGeometry</span>( <span class="js-obj-name">text</span>, <span class="js-obj-name">parameters</span> );
                        </code>
                    <!-- </pre> -->
                    <p>
                        In order for this to work, however, your TextGeometry will need an instance of THREE.Font 
                        to be set on its "font" parameter. See the <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/geometries/TextGeometry" target="_blank">TextGeometry</a> page for more info on how this can 
                        be done, descriptions of each accepted parameter, and a list of the JSON fonts that come with 
                        the THREE.js distribution itself.

                    <h2>5. Bitmap Fonts</h2>
                    <p>
                        BMFonts (bitmap fonts) allow batching glyphs into a single BufferGeometry. BMFont rendering 
                        supports word-wrapping, letter spacing, kerning, signed distance fields with standard 
                        derivatives, multi-channel signed distance fields, multi-texture fonts, and more. See 
                        <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/three-bmfont-text" target="_blank">three-bmfont-text</a>.

                    <p>
                        Stock fonts are available in projects like <a href="" target="_blank">A-Frame Fonts</a>, or you can create your own from 
                        any .TTF font, optimizing to include only characters required for a project.

                    3D models are available in hundreds of file formats, each with different purposes, assorted 
                    features, and varying complexity. Although <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples/jsm/loaders" target="_blank">three.js provides many loaders</a>, choosing the right 
                    format and workflow will save time and frustration later on. Some formats are difficult to 
                    work with, inefficient for realtime experiences, or simply not fully supported at this time.

                    <p>
                        Where possible, we recommend using glTF (GL Transmission Format). Both .GLB and .GLTF 
                        versions of the format are well supported. Because glTF is focused on runtime asset 
                        delivery, it is compact to transmit and fast to load. Features include meshes, materials, 
                        textures, skins, skeletons, morph targets, animations, lights, and cameras.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Public-domain glTF files are available on sites like <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models?features=downloadable&sort_by=-likeCount" target="_blank">Sketchfab</a>, or various tools include glTF export:

                        If your preferred tools do not support glTF, consider requesting glTF export from the 
                        authors, or posting on <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/issues/1051" target="_blank">the glTF roadmap thread</a>.

                    <p>
                        When glTF is not an option, popular formats such as FBX, OBJ, or COLLADA are also 
                        available and regularly maintained.

                    <p>
                        Only a few loaders (e.g. <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/loaders/ObjectLoader" target="_blank">ObjectLoader</a>) are included by default with three.js — others 
                        should be added to your page individually. Depending on your preference and comfort with

                        Once you've imported a loader, you're ready to add a model to your scene. Syntax varies 
                        among different loaders — when using another format, check the examples and documentation 
                        for that loader. For glTF, usage with global scripts would be:

                    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
                    <p>
                        You've spent hours modeling an artisanal masterpiece, you load it into the webpage, 
                        and — oh no! 😭 It's distorted, miscolored, or missing entirely. Start with these 
                        troubleshooting steps:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Check the JavaScript console for errors, and make sure you've used an onError 
                            callback when calling .load() to log the result.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            View the model in another application. For glTF, drag-and-drop viewers are available 
                            for <a href="https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/" target="_blank">three.js</a> and <a href="https://sandbox.babylonjs.com/" target="_blank">babylon.js</a>. If the model appears correctly in one or more 
                            applications, <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/new" target="_blank">file a bug against three.js</a>. If the model cannot be shown in any 
                            application, we strongly encourage filing a bug with the application used to create 
                            the model.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Try scaling the model up or down by a factor of 1000. Many models are scaled 
                            differently, and large models may not appear if the camera is inside the model.
                        </li>
                        <li>Try to add and position a light source. The model may be hidden in the dark.</li>
                        <li>
                            Look for failed texture requests in the network tab, like <em>C:\\Path\To\Model\texture.jpg</em>. 
                            Use paths relative to your model instead, such as <em>images/texture.jpg</em> — this may require 
                            editing the model file in a text editor.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Asking for help</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you've gone through the troubleshooting process above and your model still isn't working, 
                        the right approach to asking for help will get you to a solution faster. Post a question 
                        on the <a href="https://discourse.threejs.org/" target="_blank"></a>three.js forum and, whenever possible, include your model (or a simpler model with 
                        the same problem) in any formats you have available. Include enough information for someone 
                        else to reproduce the issue quickly — ideally, a live demo.

                    <h2>Which 3D model format is best supported?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The recommended format for importing and exporting assets is glTF (GL Transmission Format). 
                        Because glTF is focused on runtime asset delivery, it is compact to transmit and fast to load.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        three.js provides loaders for many other popular formats like FBX, Collada or OBJ as well. 
                        Nevertheless, you should always try to establish a glTF based workflow in your projects 
                        first. For more information, see <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Loading-3D-models" target="_blank">loading 3D models</a>.

                    <h2>How can scene scale be preserved on resize?</h2>
                    <p>
                        We want all objects, regardless of their distance from the camera, to appear the same size, 
                        even as the window is resized. The key equation to solving this is this formula for the 
                        visible height at a given distance:
                    </p>
                    <!-- <pre> -->
                        <code>
    <span class="js-var-name">visible_height</span> = <span class="js-int">2</span> * Math.<span class="js-method">tan</span>( ( Math.PI / <span class="js-int">180</span> ) * <span class="js-obj-name">camera</span>.fov / <span class="js-int">2</span> ) * 
    <span class="js-obj-name">distance_from_camera</span>;
                        </code>
                    <!-- </pre> -->
                    <p>
                        If we increase the window height by a certain percentage, then what we want is the visible 
                        height at all distances to increase by the same percentage. This can not be done by changing 
                        the camera position. Instead you have to change the camera field-of-view. <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Q4Jpu/" target="_blank">Example</a>.

                    <p>
                        This could be because of face culling. Faces have an orientation that decides which side 
                        is which. And the culling removes the backside in normal circumstances. To see if this is 
                        your problem, change the material side to THREE.DoubleSide.

                    information that is out of date - if something isn't working as you'd expect or as one of 
                    these links says it should, check the browser console for warnings or errors. Also check 
                    the relevant docs pages.
